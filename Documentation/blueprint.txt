We want to create a Game class, Player class, a Field class, and a Board class. We will need a lot of methods. Check win, place coin,
setting the coordiantes of the board,  place_coin, print_board, player_input, game_start, check_win, run_game, game_end. After these methods
we were also missing get_gameboard, switch_active_player, get_current_player, set_game_mode. We also implemented the computer in set game mode and
player input.
