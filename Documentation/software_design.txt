As the new developer, I’ve found many problems with the existing code. It’s not well-structured, with only a few classes 
and too much messy code. This makes it hard to read, change, or reuse. Since there aren’t enough classes, there are probably 
a lot of duplicate parts, which can cause mistakes and make updates harder. Testing will also be difficult because the code 
is not structured very well.

The code should have been kept simple and short almost stupid so it’s easy to follow. Instead, it’s long, messy, and confusing.
Many variables and functions have unclear names, making it even harder to understand. Plus, there’s not enough documentation, 
so figuring out what the code does takes much longer than it should.Important coding rules like keeping things simple, reusing code,
and using clear names were not followed.
