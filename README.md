#CONNECT4 #4WINS

This is a simple implementation of the classic Connect 4 game written in Python where the objective is 
to connect four of your symbols (coins) in a row horizontally vertically or diagonally to win the game. 
To play download the 4_gewinnt file and run it in your terminal. 

At the start you'll be asked to choose between single-player and two-player mode so type "computer" to 
play against the computer or "2players" to play against another person.
If you wish to exit the game at any time simply type "exit" or "quit".
